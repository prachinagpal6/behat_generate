@javascript @taxonomy
Feature: Creation of various taxonomies terms
  To verify various taxonomies should have correct field type,
  and can be created by User.

  Scenario Outline: Generate taxonomy terms
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "Administer vocabularies and terms" permission
    When I am on "admin/structure/taxonomy"
    Then I should see "{{ vocab }}"
    When I click "List terms" in the row with text "{{ vocab }}"
    Then I should not see the text <term>
      Examples:
      | term |
      {{ test }}
